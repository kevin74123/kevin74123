### Hello there Variable 👋

<hr>

<p>
  I am a 15-year-old boy living in South Korea,
  <br>
  pursuing coding as a side venture.
  <br>
  Although I am still young
  <br>
  and have yet to fully grasp algorithms,
  <br>
  I know how to write code.
</p>


Despite my limited understanding, 
my experiences have led me to 
create numerous projects and websites. 
For me, coding is not just a job; 
it is a form of creation that I hope to cherish.

Thank you!
