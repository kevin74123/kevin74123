### Hello there Variable 👋

<hr>
I am a 15-year-old boy living in South Korea, pursuing coding as a side venture. Although I am still young and have yet to fully grasp algorithms, I know how to write code.
Despite my limited understanding, my experiences have led me to create numerous projects and websites. For me, coding is not just a job; it is a form of creation that I hope to cherish.
Thank you!
