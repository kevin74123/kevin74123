<p>
  I am a 15-year-old boy living in South Korea,
  <br>
  pursuing coding as a side venture.
  <br>
  Although I am still young
  <br>
  and have yet to fully grasp algorithms,
  <br>
  I know how to write code.
</p>

<p>
  Despite my limited understanding,
  <br>
  my experiences have led me to
  <br>
  create numerous projects and websites.
  <br>
  For me, coding is not just a job;
  <br>
  it is a form of creation that I hope to cherish.
</p>


Thank you!
